Welcome to ThriveStream- your at home livestreaming platform for concerts. All you need is a PlayStation4+ and VR Headset to get started.

This project utilizes PlayStation VR technology to present a virtual concert experience for its users. Users can browse, purchase and stream live and prerecorded events with a click of a button. This project was built in response to the pandemic's hard hit on the entertainment industry.
